Changes

What shall we do now?

## Cool places:

hive undercity
hive spires
space port
foundry levels
fortress monastery

## Cool rules:

+/- CP
deny CP regeneration
forward deploy
alter rules of where you can attack
pre-game move
reposition terrain

fortress monastery: is a square, worth points, DA can't use it
Tau: If they don't hold the spaceport, they can only engage against the spaceport, or engage with a penalty, but start holding the spaceport
GSC: can always attack hive spaces
